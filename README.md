# Automated-Detection-of-Prosthetic-Knee-Implants

This repository contains the code and resources for our project on the automated detection of prosthetic knee implants using deep learning and multi-resolution analysis. The primary objective is to develop and evaluate a robust deep learning system capable of accurately identifying knee implants from radiographic images. This capability serves as a crucial foundation for more advanced AI applications aimed at detecting finer aspects of implant condition over time, such as degeneration, angulation, asymmetry, and surface degradation.
