# Automated-Detection-of-Prosthetic-Knee-Implants

This repository contains the code and resources for our project on the automated detection of prosthetic knee implants  done under Prof Vikram Gadre along with the guidance of Dr Anirudh Nene. 

The primary objective is to develop and evaluate a robust deep-learning system capable of accurately identifying knee implants from radiographic images. This capability serves as a crucial foundation for more advanced AI applications aimed at detecting finer aspects of implant condition over time, such as degeneration, angulation, asymmetry, and surface degradation.
